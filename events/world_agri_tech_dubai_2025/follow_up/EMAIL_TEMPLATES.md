We have direct experience supporting government food security programs in the GCC region, including:
- Feasibility studies aligned with national agricultural strategies
- Bankable project designs suitable for government financing or PPPs
- Operations training and long-term technical support

I'd welcome the opportunity to present our capabilities in more detail and discuss how RAS can support [Country's] specific targets.
