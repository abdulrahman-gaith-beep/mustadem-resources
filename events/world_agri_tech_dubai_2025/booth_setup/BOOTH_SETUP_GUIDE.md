### Layout Principles

**Open & Inviting:**
- No physical barriers blocking entry
- Team members stand in front/side of table (not behind)
- Clear sightlines into booth
- Eye contact with passersby

**Functional Zones:**
- **Front**: Greeters engage foot traffic
- **Center**: Quick conversations (standing)
- **Side**: Deeper conversations (slightly more private)
- **Back**: Materials, laptop, personal items

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- **Tallest**: Banner stands (eye-catching from distance)
- **Mid-level**: Laptop screen, QR codes (eye level when standing)
- **Table-level**: Flyers, contact cards (for people who stop)
