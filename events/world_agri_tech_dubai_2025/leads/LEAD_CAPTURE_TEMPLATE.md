## Data Entry Tips

### Speed & Accuracy

**Fast Entry During Event:**
- Use abbreviations (will clean up later)
- Focus on: Name, Email, Phone, Priority, Key Note
- Skip optional fields if busy

**Clean-Up After Event:**
- Expand abbreviations
- Complete missing fields
- Verify email addresses
- Add detailed notes

### Handwriting Clarity

**On Paper Forms:**
- Print clearly (not cursive)
- Read back email addresses to verify
- Ask person to write their own email/phone if handwriting is unclear

### Backup & Sync

**Multiple Data Points:**
- Paper forms (physical backup)
- Digital sheet (primary)
- Photos of business cards (secondary)
- QR form submissions (tertiary)

**Sync Daily:**
- Transcribe paper forms to digital sheet end of each day
- Don't wait until after event to digitize

---

## Lead Capture Discipline

### What Good Looks Like

✅ Every meaningful conversation = captured lead  
✅ Minimum info captured: Name, org, email, phone, interest  
✅ Priority tag assigned immediately  
✅ Notes written while memory fresh (within 5 min)  
✅ No "I'll remember this person" - WRITE IT DOWN  
✅ Paper backup even when QR code used  

### What to Avoid

❌ Letting people walk away without capturing info  
❌ Assuming "they'll fill out the QR form later" (many won't)  
❌ Capturing contact info but no context (can't follow up intelligently)  
❌ Waiting until end of day to record leads (forget details)  
❌ Messy handwriting on paper forms (can't read later)  
❌ Not tagging priority (everything becomes equal = nothing is urgent)

## Post-Event Data Management

### Within 24 Hours of Event End

1. **Compile All Sources:**
   - Paper forms → Digital sheet
   - QR form submissions → Digital sheet
   - Business cards → Scan/photo → Digital sheet
   - Voice notes/memory → Write up → Digital sheet

2. **Deduplicate:**
   - Check for duplicate entries (same person captured multiple times)
   - Merge information, keep most complete record

3. **Enrich Data:**
   - Look up LinkedIn profiles
   - Research organizations
   - Add any publicly available context

4. **Final Prioritization:**
   - Review all Priority A leads
   - Confirm they meet criteria
   - Re-assign team members if needed

5. **Prepare for Follow-Up:**
   - Draft personalized emails for Priority A
   - Schedule follow-up calls
   - Prepare materials to send
