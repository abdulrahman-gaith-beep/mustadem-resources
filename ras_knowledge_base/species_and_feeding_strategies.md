# Species and Feeding Strategies

## Introduction

Selecting the right fish species and implementing appropriate feeding strategies are crucial decisions that significantly impact the success of a Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS). Species selection affects system design, operational costs, market opportunities, and profitability. Feeding strategies influence growth rates, feed conversion efficiency, water quality, and overall fish health.

This document provides comprehensive guidance on species selection criteria, detailed profiles of common RAS species, nutritional requirements, feeding methodologies, and best practices for feed management in recirculating systems.

### Feeding Management Principles

#### Feeding Frequency

**General Guidelines:**
- **Fry/Juveniles:** 6-12 times per day (small stomach, high metabolism)
- **Growers:** 3-4 times per day
- **Adults:** 2-3 times per day
- **24-Hour Feeding:** Some advanced operations (salmon) use continuous feeding

**Benefits of Frequent Feeding:**
- Improved feed conversion
- Faster growth rates
- More stable water quality (smaller ammonia spikes)
- Reduced competition and stress

**Considerations:**
- Balance labor costs with benefits
- Automated feeders make frequent feeding practical
- Night feeding can improve production in some species

#### Feed Rates

**Percentage of Body Weight:**
- **Juveniles (small, fast-growing):** 3-10% body weight per day
- **Growers:** 1.5-3% body weight per day
- **Adults (near harvest):** 0.5-1.5% body weight per day

**Factors Affecting Feed Rate:**
- **Temperature:** Higher temperature = higher metabolism (to species optimum)
- **Fish Size:** Smaller fish eat more % body weight
- **Water Quality:** Poor quality reduces appetite
- **Health Status:** Sick fish eat less
- **Species:** Varies significantly

**Adjusting Feed Rates:**
- Increase gradually as fish grow (recalculate weekly)
- Reduce if water quality declines
- Observe feeding behavior (should finish in 5-15 minutes)
- Use feeding response to gauge health

#### Feeding Schedules

**Timing:**
- Consistent daily schedule preferred
- Spread feedings evenly throughout day
- Avoid feeding during or immediately after handling stress
- Consider photoperiod (light/dark cycles)

**Seasonal Adjustments:**
- Coldwater species: Reduce feeding in winter (lower temperature, metabolism)
- Warmwater species: May reduce slightly if facility temperature drops

**Pre-Harvest Fasting:**
- Stop feeding 24-48 hours before harvest
- Reduces gut content (processing quality)
- Improves flesh quality
- Reduces waste during handling and transport

### Temperature Effects on Feeding

Fish are ectothermic (cold-blooded), so temperature directly affects metabolism and feeding:

**Temperature-Feeding Relationship:**
- **Below Optimal Range:** Reduced appetite and growth
- **Optimal Range:** Maximum feed intake and growth
- **Above Optimal Range:** Stress, reduced feeding, potential mortality

**Species-Specific Responses:**
- **Trout (12-16°C optimal):** Stop feeding below 4°C, stress above 20°C
- **Tilapia (27-30°C optimal):** Minimal feeding below 18°C, stress above 32°C
- **Salmon (12-14°C optimal):** Reduced feeding below 8°C and above 18°C

**Management:**
- Adjust feed amounts based on temperature
- Use temperature-feeding charts for each species
- Monitor daily temperature and adjust accordingly

### Monitoring Feeding Behavior

**Healthy Feeding Indicators:**
- Rapid response to feeding (excitement, active swimming)
- Fish compete for food
- Consistent feeding across all fish (no individuals excluded)
- Feed consumed within 5-15 minutes
- No lethargy or hanging at surface/bottom

**Warning Signs:**
- Slow or no response to feed
- Only a few fish feeding
- Feed left uneaten after 20+ minutes
- Increased time to consume normal ration
- Fish hanging near inlets or surface (oxygen issue)

**Action When Feed Intake Declines:**
1. Check water quality immediately (DO, ammonia, nitrite, pH, temperature)
2. Observe for disease signs (lesions, abnormal behavior)
3. Review recent changes (water source, feed batch, treatments)
4. Reduce feeding until cause identified and resolved

## Feed Waste Management

### Minimizing Overfeeding

**Why It Matters:**
- **Economic:** Wasted feed = wasted money (feed is largest cost)
- **Water Quality:** Uneaten feed decomposes, producing ammonia
- **Environmental:** Excess nutrients stress biofilters and increase waste

**Best Practices:**
- **Feed to Appetite:** Observe and adjust, don't overfill
- **Use Satiation Feeding:** Feed until interest wanes, typically 5-15 minutes
- **Frequent Small Meals:** Better than infrequent large meals
- **Monitor FCR:** Feed Conversion Ratio = kg feed / kg fish gain (target species-specific optima)

### Uneaten Feed Collection

**Waste Collection Systems:**
- **Settling Basins:** Capture sinking uneaten pellets and feces
- **Drum Filters:** Remove fine particles before biofilter
- **Bottom Drains:** In tanks, regular flushing of accumulated waste

**Regular Monitoring:**
- Check waste collectors after feeding
- If significant uneaten feed found, reduce next feeding
- Quantify waste for FCR calculations

### Impact on Water Quality

**Ammonia Production:**
- Uneaten feed decomposes, adding ammonia load beyond fish excretion
- Overfeeding can double or triple ammonia input
- Strains biofilter capacity

**Dissolved Organics:**
- Feed breakdown releases proteins and carbohydrates
- Reduces water clarity
- Can affect biofilter efficiency
- Increases biological oxygen demand (BOD)

**Management:**
- Remove solids promptly and efficiently
- Size biofilters with safety margin for occasional overfeeding
- Monitor water quality more frequently after heavy feeding events

### Economic Considerations

**Feed Cost Management:**
- Track feed usage daily per tank
- Calculate FCR regularly (weekly or monthly)
- Identify tanks or cohorts with poor FCR (investigate causes)
- Benchmark against industry standards for species

**Optimizing FCR:**
- **Target FCR by Species:**
  - Trout: 1.0-1.3
  - Salmon: 1.1-1.3
  - Tilapia: 1.5-1.8
  - Catfish: 1.5-2.0
  - Barramundi: 1.3-1.6

**Factors Affecting FCR:**
- Feed quality (digestibility)
- Feeding frequency and amount
- Water temperature and quality
- Fish health and genetics
- Stress levels
- Proper sizing (avoid size variation)

**Cost per Kilogram of Fish Produced:**
- Calculate: (Total Feed Cost) / (Total Fish Weight Gain)
- Includes feed price and FCR
- Key profitability metric

## Special Considerations for RAS

### Feeding for Water Quality Management

**Strategies:**
- **Match Feed Input to Biofilter Capacity:** Avoid overloading
- **Gradual Increases:** When ramping up stocking, increase feed slowly
- **Spread Feedings:** Multiple small meals reduce ammonia spikes
- **High Water Stability Feeds:** Choose pellets that don't dissolve quickly

### Feed Selection for Minimal Waste

**Feed Characteristics:**
- **High Digestibility:** More nutrients absorbed, less waste
- **Water Stability:** Pellets hold together for 15-30 minutes
- **Low Ash Content:** Reduces solid waste production
- **Appropriate Pellet Size:** Reduces uneaten feed

**Ingredient Considerations:**
- Highly digestible proteins and fats
- Binders that maintain pellet integrity
- Avoid excessive fiber (increases solid waste)

### Feeding Schedule and System Stability

**Timing Feedings:**
- Consistent daily schedule stabilizes ammonia production
- Biofilter bacteria adapt to regular feeding patterns
- Avoid large feedings immediately before water quality sampling

**Weekend/Holiday Management:**
- Plan feeding schedules that accommodate staffing
- Consider automated feeders for consistent 7-day feeding
- Reduce feedings before extended periods without monitoring (not ideal, but safer than overfeeding)

### Observing Fish Through Feeding

**Feeding as Health Monitoring:**
- Daily feeding provides opportunity to observe all fish
- First sign of problems is often reduced appetite
- Feeding behavior indicates stress, disease, water quality issues

**What to Observe:**
- Number of fish actively feeding
- Competitiveness and eagerness
- Physical appearance (any lesions, color changes)
- Swimming behavior (erratic, lethargic, gasping)

## Summary and Best Practices

**Species Selection:**
- Match species to your market, climate, and expertise
- Consider environmental requirements and operational costs
- Start with hardy species if you're new to RAS (tilapia, catfish)
- Research local markets before committing to a species

**Feeding for Success:**
- Use high-quality, species-appropriate feeds
- Adjust feeding rates based on temperature, fish size, and behavior
- Frequent small meals optimize growth and water quality
- Monitor feeding response daily for health and system status

**Economic Efficiency:**
- Track FCR religiously (key profitability metric)
- Minimize feed waste through careful management
- Balance feed cost with quality (cheap feed often costs more due to poor FCR)
- Invest in automated systems for consistency and labor savings

**Water Quality Integration:**
- Feed management directly impacts water quality
- Size biofilters for peak feeding loads
- Adjust feeding if water quality parameters drift
- Remove solid waste promptly and efficiently

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Keep detailed records of feeding, growth, and FCR
- Benchmark performance against industry standards
- Experiment carefully with feeding strategies
- Learn from each production cycle

Success in RAS depends on selecting the right species for your market and operational capabilities, then feeding them precisely to optimize growth, health, and water quality. Understanding the nutritional needs and feeding behavior of your chosen species is fundamental to profitable and sustainable production.
