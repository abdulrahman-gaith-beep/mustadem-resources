## Regional Summary

### Western Region (Red Sea Coast)
Prime locations for marine aquaculture, particularly shrimp and marine finfish. Benefits from extensive sabkha (salt flat) areas with low land costs.

### Eastern Region (Arabian Gulf)
Industrial synergies with oil/gas sector. Access to cheap energy and existing desalination infrastructure. Good for RAS operations.

### Central Region
Inland aquaculture using groundwater. Focus on warm-water species like tilapia and catfish. Strong domestic market access via Riyadh.

### Northern Region
Coolest groundwater in the Kingdom. Potential for cold-water species including trout and sturgeon variants.

### Northwest Region (Red Sea/Gulf of Aqaba)
NEOM development zone and pristine coastal waters. Premium positioning for high-value export species.

### Southwest Region (Aseer Highlands)
Only region suitable for outdoor trout production. Tourism integration potential with eco-farms.

### Southern Region
Underutilized but with significant groundwater resources. Remote logistics but very low land costs.
