# Water Quality and Biosecurity

## Overview

Water quality management and biosecurity are the two most critical factors for successful RAS (Recirculating Aquaculture System) operations. Together, they determine fish health, growth performance, and the overall sustainability of the system. This document provides comprehensive guidance on monitoring, maintaining, and optimizing these essential parameters.

## Critical Water Quality Parameters

### pH (Potential of Hydrogen)

**Optimal Range:** 6.8–8.5 (most systems target 7.0–8.0)

pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of water and directly affects:
- Fish metabolism and stress levels
- Ammonia toxicity (lower pH reduces toxic un-ionized ammonia)
- Biofilter bacterial activity
- Nutrient availability

**Management Strategies:**
- Monitor pH at least twice daily in production systems
- Use buffers (sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate) to stabilize pH
- Maintain adequate alkalinity (70-200 mg/L) for pH buffering
- Avoid sudden pH changes (>0.5 units) that can stress fish
- Consider CO2 stripping if pH drops due to CO2 accumulation

### Dissolved Oxygen (DO)

**Optimal Range:** 5–7 mg/L minimum; >7 mg/L for high-density systems

Dissolved oxygen is essential for:
- Fish respiration and metabolism
- Aerobic bacteria in biofilters
- Oxidation of organic matter
- Overall system health

**Management Strategies:**
- Use oxygen generators, diffusers, or venturi injectors
- Monitor continuously with automated sensors
- Increase aeration during feeding and high activity periods
- Maintain backup aeration systems for emergencies
- Target DO levels at 80-100% saturation for optimal growth
- Account for temperature effects (warmer water holds less oxygen)

### Temperature

**Optimal Range:** Species-dependent (7–30°C range)

Temperature affects:
- Metabolic rate and growth
- Oxygen solubility
- Ammonia toxicity
- Disease susceptibility
- Feed conversion efficiency

**Common Species Requirements:**
- Cold water (7-16°C): Trout, salmon, charr
- Moderate (18-24°C): Bass, perch
- Warm water (24-30°C): Tilapia, catfish, barramundi

**Management Strategies:**
- Use heaters, chillers, or heat exchangers for precise control
- Implement heat recovery systems to reduce energy costs
- Monitor temperature continuously
- Avoid fluctuations >2°C per day
- Insulate tanks and facilities to maintain stability

### Total Ammonia Nitrogen (TAN)

**Target Level:** <1 mg/L (ideally <0.5 mg/L for sensitive species)

Ammonia is produced from:
- Fish waste (urine and gill excretion)
- Decomposition of uneaten feed
- Bacterial breakdown of organic matter

**Toxicity:**
- Un-ionized ammonia (NH3) is highly toxic to fish
- Causes gill damage, reduced growth, immune suppression
- Toxicity increases with higher pH and temperature

**Management Strategies:**
- Ensure adequate biofilter capacity (nitrifying bacteria)
- Avoid overfeeding
- Remove solid waste promptly
- Monitor TAN levels daily or continuously
- Increase water exchange if levels rise
- Consider emergency measures: reduce feeding, add zeolite

### Nitrite (NO2-)

**Target Level:** <0.5 mg/L (preferably <0.1 mg/L for sensitive species)

Nitrite is an intermediate product in the nitrogen cycle:
- Produced by Nitrosomonas bacteria from ammonia
- Converted to nitrate by Nitrobacter bacteria

**Toxicity:**
- Interferes with oxygen transport in fish blood
- Causes "brown blood disease" (methemoglobinemia)
- Can be lethal at elevated concentrations

**Management Strategies:**
- Maintain healthy nitrifying bacteria populations
- Add salt (NaCl) at 1-3 ppt to reduce nitrite uptake by fish
- Avoid biofilter disruptions (temperature shock, pH extremes)
- Monitor during system startup and after disturbances
- Reduce feeding if nitrite spikes occur

### Nitrate (NO3-)

**Target Level:** <100 mg/L (upper safety limit 200–300 mg/L)

Nitrate is the end product of nitrification:
- Less toxic than ammonia or nitrite
- Accumulates over time in closed systems
- Can impair long-term fish health and reproduction at high levels

**Management Strategies:**
- Implement denitrification (anaerobic biofilters)
- Regular water exchanges (5-10% daily typical)
- Use aquaponics to remove nitrate through plant uptake
- Monitor weekly or bi-weekly
- Consider biofloc systems for nutrient recycling

### Alkalinity and Hardness

**Alkalinity:** 70-200 mg/L as CaCO3
**Hardness:** 50-100 mg/L as CaCO3

**Importance:**
- Alkalinity provides pH buffering capacity
- Supports nitrifying bacteria
- Essential for fish osmoregulation
- Prevents pH crashes

**Management Strategies:**
- Add sodium bicarbonate or calcium carbonate
- Monitor weekly
- Target alkalinity >100 mg/L for stable systems
- Ensure adequate calcium and magnesium for hardness

### Carbon Dioxide (CO2)

**Target Level:** <15 mg/L (ideally <10 mg/L)

High CO2 levels cause:
- Respiratory stress in fish
- Reduced pH (carbonic acid formation)
- Decreased growth and feed efficiency
- Increased disease susceptibility

**Management Strategies:**
- Use aeration towers or cascades for CO2 stripping
- Increase surface agitation
- Monitor if pH drops unexpectedly
- Ensure adequate air exchange in facility

### Other Parameters

**Total Suspended Solids (TSS):** <20 mg/L
**Total Gas Pressure:** <100% saturation (prevent gas bubble disease)
**Salinity:** Match species requirements (freshwater: <0.5 ppt)

- Insects may vector pathogens

**Visitors and Staff:**
- Can carry pathogens on clothing, footwear, hands
- Cross-contamination from other farms
- Disease introduction via equipment

**Feed and Supplies:**
- Contaminated feed can introduce pathogens
- Equipment from other facilities may carry disease

### Internal Hazards

**Equipment:**
- Nets, pumps, hoses shared between tanks
- Inadequately disinfected tools

**Personnel Practices:**
