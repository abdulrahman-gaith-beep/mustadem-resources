## 🎯 ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES

1. **Numbered folders (01-07)** = Easy sequential access
2. **Descriptive names** = Know what's inside without opening
3. **Clear categories** = Find by function, not by date
4. **Preserved originals** = Mustadem & Marj kept intact
5. **Yastadeem labeled** = Properly identified as processing facility
